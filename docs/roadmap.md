# Full Roadmap for this project, including a tutorial to get up and running


The tutorial is here: [How to use github and git](./tutorial.md)

## Overview

- [x] We both pushed to GitHub!
- [x] Pick initial hardware and setups
- [ ] Obtain hardware
- [ ] Flash basic code to microcontroller
- [ ] Make radio work
- [ ] Read sensors and transmit data over radio
- [ ] Solenoid working for release

## Getting started
Now that we've started with coding we actually need parts. I'll give the other collaborators an update when we have the partsslo we can start flashing code to the arduino. This will go to the communications section. 

## Hardware we'll be using (buy list)
- [Adafruit LoRa RFM9x](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3073) which is the radio of choice, *2, (send and receive)
- [Arduino Nano ATMega328P](https://thepihut.com/products/arduino-nano) *2 (send and receive)
- [BMP280](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2651)
- [Battery](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1578)
- [Solenoid](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2776)
- 100 µF electrolytic cap *2 (battery) --skip this
- Solar panels -- awaiting on the part
## Language and how to work with it
I'll put the arduino C++ boilerplate and some code examples here.
