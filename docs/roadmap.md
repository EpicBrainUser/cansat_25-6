# Full Roadmap for this project, including a tutorial to get up and running


The tutorial is here: [How to use github and git](./tutorial.md)

## Overview

- [x] We both pushed to GitHub!
- [ ] Obtain hardware
- [ ] Flash basic code to microcontroller
- [ ] One way communication for primary mission with sensors
- [ ] Solenoid working for release

## Getting started

Let's make sure we can both collaborate to write code here, first of all follow the tutorial and push a change to github. Further instructions will await... :)

## Hardware we'll be using
- [Adafruit LoRa RFM9x](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3073) which is the radio of choice, *2, (send and receive)
- [Arduino Nano ATMega328P](https://thepihut.com/products/arduino-nano) *2 (send and receive)
These are the very very crucial things we really need and don't have  
These below are things I'm just looking at that we might need:
- 3.7 V LiPo 250–500 mAh
- 100 µF electrolytic cap *2 (radio setup)
- BMP280 or something
